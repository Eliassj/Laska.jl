	abstract = {The basic electrical rhythmicity of the olivocerebellar system was investigated
              in vivo
              using multiple electrode recordings of Purkinje cell ({PC}) complex spike ({CS}) activity. {CSs} demonstrate a 10 Hz rhythmicity, thought to result from the interaction of Ca

              and Ca

              -dependent K

              conductances present in inferior olivary ({IO}) neurons. To assess the roles of different K
              +
              channels in generating this rhythmicity, intraolivary microinjections of charybdotoxin ({CTX}) and apamin were used. Both K
              +
              channel blockers increased average {CS} spike-firing rates. However, apamin produced a tonic increase in firing with a decrement in the {CS} rhythmicity. In contrast, after {CTX} administration, highly rhythmic {CS} discharges were interleaved with silent periods, suggesting that apamin- and {CTX}-sensitive K
              +
              channels have distinct rhythmogenic roles in {IO} neurons. {CTX}-sensitive channels seem to be functionally coupled to low threshold Ca
              2+
              channels, whereas the apamin-sensitive channels relate to high threshold Ca
              2+
              channels.

              receptors increases {IO} excitability and the spatial distribution of synchronized {CS} activity while disrupting its rostrocaudal banding pattern (Lang et al., 1996). The present experiments show that K
              +
              channel blockers increase {IO} excitability without causing widespread synchronization of {CS} activity. Thus, changes in the {IO} excitability have relatively little effect in determining the spatial organization of {CS} synchrony. In contrast, the degree of {CS} rhythmicity seemed to influence the patterns of {CS} synchrony. Thus, after {CTX}, increased {CS} rhythmicity was associated with increased intraband synchrony and decreased interband synchrony, whereas apamin had the opposite effects on intra- and interband synchronization.},
