# Laska.jl documentation

Welcome to the WIP documentation for the WIP package Laska.jl.

Laska.jl is an attempt at providing functions for importing, manipulating and visualizing
data obtained from Neuropixel probes using spikeGLX and preprocessed in KiloSort and Phy.

The package is currently divided into:

- **LaskaCore**: Types, importing data, basic summary statistics
- **LaskaStats:** Summary statistics and similar.
- **LaskaPlot:** Plotting functions using Makie.

Importing `Laska` will include all of the above and reexport their functions.
